GitHub provides desktop clients that include a graphical user
interface for the most common repository actions and an automatically updating command line edition of Git for advanced scenarios.

In Visual Studio Code, you can open an integrated terminal, initially starting at the root of your workspace. This can be convenient as you don't have to switch windows or alter the state of an existing terminal to perform a quick command-line task.

You can create multiple terminals open to different locations and easily navigate between them. Terminal instances can be added by clicking the plus icon on the top-right of the TERMINAL panel or by triggering the Ctrl+Shift+` command. This action creates another entry in the drop-down list that can be used to switch between them.
